# DrawingDelver
 Processing prototype that turns screenshots of drawings into playable levels
 
A prototype that turns pictures of drawings into zelda style levels.

It looks at colors and shapes to decide the position and size of each playable element and then creates a virtual representation of the drawing.

Drawing instructions are included in a txt.

Originally done as an assignment in a Human-Computer Interaction course, as such anything that is not explicitly mine, belongs to their respective creators.
